🔒 Component Locking Policy
Do NOT modify core components in src/components/ui/. Only bugs/accessibility fixes allowed.

- Refer to the DESIGN CODEX as Component Reference for All UI Elements.
- Make use of the PAGE TRANSITION GLITCH for backward navigating UI flows.
- Make use of the GLITCH (CHROMATIC ABERRATION) for when input fields are invalid.

IMPORTANT: globals.css is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for all styles. Do NOT create component-level CSS files. 

Use thematic copy to prompt the user to take action or to inform.
Sparingly include thematic status indicators to create some visual intrest.


WARNING! The file tree is very complex and can be very hard to navigate. Use the file tree to find the files you need.
